                This is a biography of Jawaharlal Nehru.Jawaharlal Nehru, 
                Indira Gandhi’s father, was a leader of India’s nationalist
                 movement and became India’s first prime minister after its 
                 independence.Jawaharlal Nehru joined the Indian National Congress
                  and joined Indian Nationalist leader Mahatma Gandhi’s independence
                   movement. In 1947, Pakistan was created as a new, independent country 
                   for Muslims. The British withdrew and Nehru became independent India’s
                    first prime minister.Nehru was born in Allahabad, India in 1889. His father
                     was a renowned lawyer and one of Mahatma Gandhi's notable lieutenants.
                      A series of English governesses and tutors educated Nehru at home until
                       he was 16. He continued his education in England, first at the Harrow School
                        and then at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he earned an honors degree in
                         natural science. He later studied law at the Inner Temple in London before
                          returning home to India in 1912 and practicing law for several years. Four
                           years later, Nehru married Kamala Kaul; their only child,
                            Indira Priyadarshini, was born in 1917.

            <blockquote> Political career of Jawaharlal Nehru began after his return
                 from England in the year 1912. On his return he joined the Allahabad
                  High Court as a barrister, but soon he lost interest in legal career.
                   Instead he was attracted towards the national movements for home rule.
                    In the year 1912 he made his first appearance at the Indian National
                     Congress as a delegate to the Bankipore Session. During World War I,
                      Nehru volunteered for St. John Ambulance and spoke out against the
                       censorship acts passed by the British government in India. He also
                        took active interest in All India Home Rule League under Bal Gangadhar
                         Tilak and Annie Beasant. Nehru campaigned on behalf of Indian National
                          Congress against the bonded labour system forced upon Indian workers 
                          in Fiji as well as the prejudice faced by Indians in South Africa.</blockquote>

            <p>He once said, <q cite="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/89095.Jawaharlal_Nehru">
            A language is something infinitely greater
                 than grammar and philology. It is the poetic testament of the genius
                  of a race and a culture, and the living embodiment of the thoughts and fancies
                that have moulded them. <br> </q> <cite>Jawaharlal Nehru</cite></p>

                <p>The policy of being too cautious is the greatest risk of all.
